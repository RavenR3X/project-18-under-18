        <h4 class="header-info">So, to conduct an eye test at home is fairly easy while using this website, but it doesn't fully analyze your eyes,  you will have to contact an optician do it the advanced way, and this is just made to <b> check your eyesight </b>so, without any further ado lets get started.</h4>

    <label class="instructions">1.Place the facing chart (called 'E Chart' at a distance of 3 meters/9.6 feet) on your Tab, Laptop or paper print.</label>
    <label class="instructions2">2.Cover your left eye with one hand and try to determine which direction the character 'E' is facing, use your right eye.</label>
    <label class="instructions3">3.When finished with right eye, repeat the exercise with left eye.</label>
    <label class="instructions4">4.This can also be exercised to determine wether the glasses someone is currently using are still good for him</label>
    <label class="instructions5">5.Smaller the symbols you can determine, better is your eyesight. The figures below each line of symbols tell how good or weak the eyesight is.</label>
    <label class="instructions6">6.Normal eyesight falls between 6/6 and 6/15. Higher numbers represent weaker eyesight.</label>
    <label class="instructions7">7. 6/6 - 6/9 is normal vision, no glasses needed.</label>
    <label class="instructions8">8.If your vision is less than normal, consult an eye specialist near your house.</label>
    <label class="instructions9">9.When eyesight is found weak, try checking vision through a pinhole. Pinhole phenomenon can be developed pinning a small pin-sized hole in a hard paper and covering eye with that paper, positioning the pinhole so the subject can see through that small hole.</label>
    <label class="instructions10">10.If vision improves with pinhole, you can get glasses from a optician but you must see an ophthalmologist.</label>
    <label class="instructions11">11.This is good for checking only distant eyesight</label>
